# Angular - Exercise 6 - Components
The purpose of this exercise is to get familiar with Angular Router.
The final goal is to enable navigation between a couple of views.

## Before ...
The existing app is created using Angular-Cli. Familiarise yourself with the project structure.

The app runs like that
```bash
$ ng serve
```

App is served at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

## Let's start
Make sure there's `<base href="/">` inside the `<header>...</header>`.

Then, define the necessary routes.

Note: You may want to set `enableTracing` to `true` when developing the app. 

**Good Luck!**

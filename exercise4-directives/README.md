# Angular - Exercise 4 - Directives
The purpose of this exercise is to get familiar with Angular Directives.
The final goal is to create a todo-list application.

## Before ...
The existing app is created using Angular-Cli. Familiarise yourself with the structure of the  code.

The app runs like that
```bash
$ ng serve
```

App is served in [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

We have created 2 components for you:

1. TodosListsComponent
2. TodoItemComponent

And also 1 service:

1. TodosService

## Let's start
Create an attribute Directive which will strike-through the title of a completed todo-item.
You need to update the TodoItemComponent accordingly.
Directive names should not conflict with standard HTML attributes, so try ading a prefix.

**Good Luck!**

# Angular 2 - Exercise 1 - Modules
The purpose of this exercise is to get familiar with Angular 2 Modules.
The final goal is to create a todo-list application.

## Before ...
The existing app is created using Angular-Cli. Familiarise yourself with the structure of the  code.

The app runs like that
```bash
$ ng serve
```

App is served in [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

## Let's start
Create a new module in its own folder inside src/.
It is a good practice to use 'Module' as suffix, so name your module 'TodosModule'.
The module will be empty in the beginning, however we want the module to log a simple
message in the console when it is loaded/imported.
Import your module into the main AppModule and verify that a message (i.e 'It works')
is logged in the console.

**Good Luck!**

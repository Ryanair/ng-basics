# Angular - Exercise 1 - Modules
The purpose of this exercise is to get familiar with Angular Modules.
The final goal is to create a todo-list application.

## Before ...
The existing app is created using Angular CLI. Familiarise yourself with the project structure.

The app runs like that
```bash
$ ng serve
```

App is served at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

## Let's start
Create a new module in its own folder inside `src`.

It is a good practice to use 'Module' as suffix, so name your module 'TodosModule'.

The module will be empty in the beginning, however we want the module to log a simple
message in the console when it is loaded/imported.

Import your module into the main `AppModule` and verify that a message ('It works')
is logged in the console.
